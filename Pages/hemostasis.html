        <h3 class="study-header overview-title">Project Overview</h3>
        <p class="overview-description">PROCEPT BioRobotics is a medical device company that specializes in the treatment of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia using a method known as Aquablation. After the Aquablation procedure is complete, many patients experience excessive bleeding. So, as a possible solution to help stop the bleeding, the R&amp;D team designed a device that can be used to cauterize tissue during the procedure. Our task was to integrate the new feature into our main software coined as Hemostasis.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container wrapper">
        <h3 class="study-header">The Problem</h3>
        <p>A new device has been added to the main product, integrate new features into the software which can be utilized by the users during procedures.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container wrapper">
        <h3 class="study-header">Challenges</h3>
        <p>Designing a new feature for a software becomes a lot more difficult if it's extremely dependant on the hardware. Both the device used for cauterization and the new feature in the software were being designed at the same time, so if the device needs changes, the software will most likely have to change as well.</p>
        <p>The timeline for this first iteration is short, so the new features should utilize components that already exist in the software. This would save the developers' time.</p>

    <div class="container persona-header">
        <h3 class="study-header">The Users</h3>
        <p>With the assistance from the engineering, marketing and software development teams, we were able to gather research on the current users of the product. We were easily able to determine main pain points the users might have when using our product.</p>

        <h3 class="study-header">The Current Software</h3>
        <p>The main software is divided into three panels: the left panel which usually contains instructional information as well as the buttons to proceed forward and back in the procedure; the middle panel which shows the ultrasound and TRUS data; and the right panel which shows all the steps and buttons to control the device.</p>

    <div class="container persona-header">
        <h3 class="study-header">Informational Architecture</h3>
        <p>Luckily, we were easily able to integrate the new steps at the end of planning and treatment phase. The treatment phase was originially one step, but for the new design it was split up into two steps: Hemostasis and Cauterize.</p>
    </div>

        <p>
            For the new hemostasis treatment, after completing the Aquablation step, there will be a third new option to start the automated hemostasis treatment. After the hemostasis treatment is complete, the user will be brought back to the "pass complete" screen.

        <p>
            There were four screens that needed to be added in the new software: two in the planning phase and two during the treatment phase. We reused many of the components that already existed in the software.

        <h3 class="study-header extra-padding-top">High Fidelity Prototypes </h3>
        <p> We utilized Invision Studios to create prototypes that were presented to stake holders. We designed the animation for the collapsible tabs as well as the hover states for the selectable sections. Lastly, we also designed the ability to adjust the angle for each section and the transition from the decision screen to the treatment phase.</p>

        <h3 class="study-header extra-padding-top">Final Takeaway</h3>
        <p>Designing for a medical device company proved to be a lot different than designing most products. The users were narrowed down to a very specific group, in our case it was urologist, which can set limits to the amount of research we can gather.</p>
        <p>When designing a product that is highly reliant on a hardware component, it's very important that the mechanical engineers, software developers and UI designers work very closely to plan it. The mechanical engineers need to make sure the UI designers understand what features should be included in order to control the hardware. The UI Designers need to work with the software developers to understand limitations of the software and pass along the design requiremnts. Errors can occur if there is a gap of knowledge between these teams.</p>
